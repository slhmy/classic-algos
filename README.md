# Classic Algos

I personally always forget some classic algorithms after I didn't use them for some time.

So I build this repository to record these algorithms to help me quickly understand them again.

## Catalog

### C++

- String matching
  - [KMP (The Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm)](cpp/kmp)
- Palindrome search
  - [Manacher](cpp/manacher)
- Sort
  - [MergeSort](cpp/merge-sort)
- Relationship derivation
  - [UnionFind Set](cpp/union-find-set)
- Nearest Distance
  - [Dijkstra](cpp/dijkstra)
- Data Structure
  - [Binary Indexed Tree](cpp/binary-indexed-tree)

## Edit and Run

This repo is expected to be Linux & MacOS friendly. If you are using Windows, you can use WSL or other Linux environment to run the code.

VSCode settings are well prepared, directly visiting the source code and run it should be fine.
