## Complement

The negative bit value of a positive int, is used in style of complement.

Let's take -6 as the example,
the bit value of 6 (in i8) is, '0000 0110'.

Now we <u> first turn over all the zero and one value </u> we can see,
this will make it into '1111 1001'.
Then add '1' on to '1111 1001', and make it into '1111 1010',
this is the final value we want to get.
